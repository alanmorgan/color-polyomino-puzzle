# color-polyomino-puzzle

Bootstraps off my polyomino solver.

Find a set of pentominoes that are colored, such that when you form a rectangle, the colors themselves make a complete set of pentominoes.

One obvious question is if you can create a set of colored pentominoes such that you can form multiple different rectangles of different sizes with that property. I suspect the answer is "no".
